This repository is my submission for the Udacity Android ND project "xyz-reader".

The first commit is an updated version of https://github.com/udacity/xyz-reader-starter-code.git. This commit has no additional functionality, it is only updated so it can compile and run using the current versions of Android Studio and emulator.
